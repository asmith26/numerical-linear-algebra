NMF is a factorization of a non-negative data set $V$: $$ V = W H$$ into non-negative matrices $W,\\; H$. Often positive factors will be **more easily interpretable** (and this is the reason behind NMF's popularity). \n",

In *stochastic* gradient descent, we evaluate our loss function on just a sample of our data (sometimes called a *mini-batch*).  We would get different loss values on different samples of the data, so this is *why it is stochastic*.  It turns out that this is still an effective way to optimize, and it's much more efficient!\n",

    "Above, we used our knowledge of what the gradient of the loss function was to do SGD from scratch in PyTorch.  However, PyTorch has an automatic differentiation package, [autograd](http://pytorch.org/docs/autograd.html) which we could use instead.  This is really useful, in that we can use autograd on problems where we don't know what the derivative is.  \n",

    "The approach we use below is very general, and would work for almost any optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, Variables have the same API as tensors, but Variables remember the operations used on to create them.  This lets us take derivatives."
